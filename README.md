Completed this Project - "National Railway Reservation System" as a part of my Academic Requirement during my 2nd semester.

The NRCTC railway reservation system facilitates the passengers to enquiry about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, booking and cancellation of tickets, enquiry about the status of the booked ticket, etc. The aim of case study is to design and develop a data base maintaining records of different trains, train status and passengers.This project contains introduction to the railways reservation system. It is the computerized system of reserving the seats of train seats in advance. It is mainly used for a long route. Online reservation has made the process for the reservation of seats very much easier than ever before.
